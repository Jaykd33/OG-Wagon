# 🚗 OG WAGON – A Bluetooth-Controlled Arduino Car

A hands-on R&D project built with passion and teamwork during my 1st year of B.E CSE (AIML).  
Presenting to you — **OG WAGON**, a Bluetooth-controlled car powered by **Arduino UNO**, controlled via smartphone. Simple, fun, and full of learning!

## 🛠️ What We Built

We built a mini robotic car that can be moved wirelessly using Bluetooth via an Android phone. The car uses Arduino UNO as its brain, and the HC-05 Bluetooth module as its ears!

### 🔩 Components Used:
- Arduino UNO  
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module  
- L293D Motor Driver Shield  
- TT DC Motors & Wheels  
- Li-ion Batteries  
- Jumper Wires, Soldering Kit  
- LEDs & Resistors  
- Android app: Bluetooth RC Controller v1.0

## 💻 Tech & Code

We used **Arduino IDE** to write and upload the code that handles motor movement based on signals received from the HC-05 Bluetooth module. Commands like `'F'`, `'B'`, `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'T'` control the direction of the car — Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop respectively.

## ✨ What We Learned

🧠 Building OG WAGON taught us more than just hardware and code. Here's what we gained:

- 🔧 Practical hands-on experience with circuits, motors, and modules  
- 🧑‍💻 Arduino programming and Bluetooth communication  
- 🤝 Team collaboration, problem-solving, and patience  
- 🔌 Soldering & fixing hardware with care  
- 🧠 Understanding the real-world application of theoretical concepts

## 🏁 Final Words

From brainstorming to soldering wires and finally seeing our OG WAGON roll — this journey was filled with effort, fun, learning, and memories.  
We hope this project inspires fellow students to get hands-on and create something amazing!
